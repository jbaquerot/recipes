Ingredients
For Dough
2 cups sifted all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
1/4 teaspoon table salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter
1 cup sugar
1 large egg
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, for decorating
For Decorating
1 large egg white
1 teaspoon water
Sanding sugar

Directions
Step 1
In a large bowl, sift together flour, salt, and baking powder. Set aside.
Step 2
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat
together the butter and sugar on medium speed until fluffy, about 3 minutes.
Add egg, and beat until smooth, about 1 minute.

Step 3
Add reserved flour mixture, and mix on low speed until thoroughly combined.
Stir in vanilla. Wrap dough in plastic, and refrigerate for about 45 minutes.

Step 4
Make cookie pattern and heart stencil while wrapped dough is chilling.
For the pattern, have your child trace his or her hand on a manila file folder,
and cut out the tracing. You will lay this on the dough and trace around it with
the tip of a paring knife. For the heart stencil, cut a heart shape from a piece
of parchment paper, discarding center.

Step 5
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
On a well-floured work surface, roll out cold dough to 1/8 inch thick.
Cut out hand shapes. Transfer cookies to prepared baking sheets.
Refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes. Dough scraps may be re-rolled twice.

Step 6
To decorate the cookies with sanding sugar hearts, lay the heart stencil over
a cookie. Combine the egg white with the water in a small bowl. Brush the egg
wash in the heart, and sprinkle with sanding sugar. Lift stencil and repeat
with remaining cookies. Bake until edges just begin to brown lightly, 8 to 10
minutes. Let cookies cool on pans for 3 minutes before transferring to wire
racks to cool completely.
